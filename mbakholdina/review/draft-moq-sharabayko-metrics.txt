1.  Introduction

   TODO: Media over QUIC has emerged.

   For live media contribution when processing of data takes place in
   real time, it is important to estimate packets transmission delays
   and delay variation (or jitter), determine data loss and reordering
   as well as calculate other performance metrics Section 5.

   (??) The less jitter is observed, the less buffer a decoder must
   have, and the more confidence in a transmission latency constraints
   can be gained and utilized.

   The current draft discusses the approach of (??) objectively
   measuring the performance metrics of QUIC connections (both STREAMS
   and DATAGRAMS) using an artificially generated payload.

   This approach could be used during the Media over QUIC protocol
   development to:

   *  evaluate the STREAMS versus DATAGRAMS performance and efficiency,

   *  compare the independent implementations of the Media over QUIC
      protocol or perform regression testing of the same implementation,

   *  evaluate various congestion control schemes considered for
      implementation.

   (??) The same approach can be used for the other protocols, why not
   to say about it

   (?? Why not to simply use QUIC statistics provided by the library.
   Provide motivation for these

   (??) Are we going to add links to the srt-xtransmit application as an
   example of implementation

                        Figure 1: Payload Structure

   Payload Sequence Number: 64 bits.  A sequential number of the
      payload.  Starts from zero and is incremented for every payload
      that follows.

   (??) packet instead of payload

   NTP 64-bit Timestamp: 64 bits.  NTP 64-bit (?? system clock)
      timestamp [RFC5905] [RFC8877] of the moment the payload has been
      generated meaning payload generation has finished. (?? delete:
      System clock.)

   (??) NTP 64-Bit Timestamp - why 64-bit is here?

   Monotonic Clock Timestamp: 64 bits.  Monotonic clock timestamp of the
      moment the payload has been generated.  Represents microseconds
      elapsed since (?? the last) monotonic clock epoch.

   Payload Length: 32 bits.  The full length of the payload (including
      preceding "Payload Sequence Number" and both timestamp fields).

   MD5 Checksum: 128 bits.  A hash value to confirm the payload
      integrity.  Calculated for the whole message with the SHA-128
      checksum field zeroed out (?? what does it mean - zeroed out).

   Remaining Payload: variable length.  The remaining payload is
      generated to form the whole DATAGRAM packet of the whole STREAM
      (?? what does it mean - I don't like "whole", maybe "complete").
      Randomly generated sequence of bytes.  MAY be generated as a
      sequence of 8-bit integers starting with value of the remainder
      after dividing the Payload Sequence Number by 32 and followed by
      sequentially increasing values.

   In the case of QUIC DATAGRAM, the payload size MUST fit exactly into
   a single DATAGRAM (?? frame).  The "Payload Sequence Number" MUST be
   increased for each sent DATAGRAM.

   In the case of QUIC STREAMS, the payload size MUST form the whole
   STREAM (?? again "whole).

5.  Performance Metrics

   The calculation of the following metrics is suggested to be included
   in the scope:

   *  Transmission Delay (or Latency) Section 5.1,

   *  Interarrival Jitter as per [RFC3550] Section 5.2,

   *  Time-Stamped Delay Factor (TS-DF) Section 5.3,

   *  Total Number of Received Payloads Section 5.4,

   *  Total Number of Missing Payloads Section 5.5,

   *  TODO: rest

   (?? What about Throughput)

   TODO: elaborate on this (this is only applied to TS-DF metric) + the
   concept of measurement period (maybe picture is required)

   The RECOMMENDED measurement period is 1 second, but other values are
   also possible.

5.1.  Transmission Delay

   Transmission Delay (or Latency) is measured based on the system clock
   (NTP 64-bit Timestamp Figure 1).  It is RECOMMENDED to synchronize
   the clocks on both sender and receiver machines before an experiment
   so that calculated latency values are as close as possible to the
   observed transmission delays.

   TODO: Picture is required

   Transmission Delay (TD) sample is calculated at the receiver side at
   the moment a payload is received by an application:

   TD = T_NTP_RCV - T_NTP_SND + OFFSET

   where - T_NTP_RCV is the time when the payload arrives (??) according
   to the system clock at the receiver.  Note that for QUIC STREAMS, the
   T_NTP_RCV is the time when the last byte of a stream is received by
   an application. - T_NTP_SND is the NTP 64-bit Timestamp value
   extracted from the payload, - OFFSET is the timing offset which
   results from the difference in the system time of the two clocks (so
   called clock drift) at the sender and at the receiver.

   Minimum (TD_MIN) and maximum (TD_MAX) transmission delay estimates
   MUST be reset to N/A (?? not defined, maybe 0) at the start of each
   measurement period while the smoothed estimate (TD_SMOOTHED) is
   calculated during the entire experiment.

   TD_MIN = MIN(TD_MIN, TD);
   TD_MAX = MAX(TD_MAX, TD);
   TD_SMOOTHED = RMA(TD_SMOOTHED, TD).

   TODO: What's RMA?  Add formula.  TODO: Define what's ""smoothed"

5.2.  Interarrival Jitter

   Interarrival Jitter is calculated as defined in [RFC3550].

   TODO: Formula, maybe later ...

   The calculation is based on the Monotonic Clock Timestamp Figure 1
   extracted from the payload. (?? TODO: Rephrase) This value is
   smoothed and MUST NOT be reset at the start of each measurement
   period.

5.3.  Time-Stamped Delay Factor (TS-DF)

   Time-Stamped Delay Factor (TS-DF) metric is calculated as defined in
   [EBU3337].

   The calculation of TS-DF samples is based on the Monotonic Clock
   Timestamp Figure 1 extracted from the payload.  Unlike the jitter
   algorithm in [RFC3550], the TS-DF algorithm does not use a smoothing
   factor and therefore gives a very accurate instantaneous result.

   As per the specification, the recommended measurement period is 1
   second, but other values are also possible.

5.4.  Total Number of Received Payloads

   A counter is initialized with zero and incremented on each payload
   read.  The value MUST NOT be reset at the start of each measurement
   period.

5.5.  Total Number of Missing Payloads

   A counter is initialized with zero and is incremented each time a
   discontinuity in consecutive Payload Sequence Number Figure 1 values
   is observed.  The missing sequence numbers MUST be recorded.  The
   counter is decremented by one if a missing sequence is received out
   of order.  The value MUST NOT be reset at the start of each
   measurement period.

5.6.  Total Number of Reordered Packets and Reordering Distance

   (?? Reordered payloads)

   A counter is initialized with zero and is incremented each time the
   Payload Sequence Number Figure 1 value precedes the next Expected
   Payload Sequence Number.

   The next Expected Payload Sequence Number is initialized with zero
   and is updated if the Payload Sequence Number value of a received
   payload incremented by one exceeds the current Expected Payload
   Sequence Number value.

   The value MUST NOT be reset at the start of each measurement period.

   (?? Reordering Distance isn't defined)

5.7.  The Number of Malformed Payloads

   TODO

5.8.  The Number of Duplicated Payloads
